## Facepoke

Poke back everyone who pokes you on Facebook.

NOTE: Once the script is run via the Browser console or as a bookmarklet,
refresh the page to see the changes. This is because of the ajaxy behavior
of facebook.

## TODO

- Autoloader to autoload the script on visiting facebook.com.
- Check to prevent facepoke from acting when there are no pokers listed on the /pokes page.
- Make sure all the pokers are poked. Handle the promise.
